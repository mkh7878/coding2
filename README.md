# Week 2: Circle Slider Instrument

In my first attempt at making a program to explore the relationship between movement, colour and music, this program uses a gui slider to allow the user to play music. The slider/music is tied to the visuals of the circle changing size and colour. This is a theme I explored further in my final project.
