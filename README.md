## CODING 2

This a repository of my homework assignments for my MSC in creative computing at UAL. 

The assignments are as follows:

1. Circle Slider Instrument (OpenFrameworks/C++): In my first attempt at making a program to explore the relationship between movement, colour and music, this program uses a gui slider to allow the user to play music. The slider/music is tied to the visuals of the circle changing size and colour. This is a theme I explored further in my final project.

2. Boids: This project uses an artificial life simulator to ccreate a flock of dots that move around the screen in a "natural" way reacting to each other's movement. The assignment was to create a child class of the parent class Boid (mine is called Fish) and to make a second flock that does not intersect with the original flock.

3. [Python Challenge!](https://mkh7878.github.io/pythonchallenge/)
This is a challenge inspired by the [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/). In the source code of the page is hidden a string of X's and O's. As suggested in the horrific graphics on the webpage, there is a secret message hidden within the O's. The number of O's between each X spells out a word when you convert those numbers into chars.

4. [Python Homework:](https://github.com/mkh7878/coding2/blob/Python_NumpyHW/Mae%20Horak%20Python%20Homework%20Attempt%202.ipynb) Image transformation using numpy. I used numpy to take images and separate them out by pixel colour and then stack the pixels on each other to make interesting graph-like visuals.
