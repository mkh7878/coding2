# Homework Week 3

This project uses an artificial life simulator to ccreate a flock of dots that move around the screen in a "natural" way reacting to each other's movement.
The assignment was to create a child class of the parent class Boid (mine is called Fish) and to make a second flock that does not intersect with the original flock.
